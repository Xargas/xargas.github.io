      <div class="blog-content"><p>Over time I gathered a bunch of USB sticks I wanted to verify if they are still good and usable. For such a task I found the tools <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f3probe</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fio</code>.
So, I installed both on a Linux based PC (I used a Gentoo based one, but WSL based should also do).</p>

Of course, the code is still a prototype, but it is working and shows the intended workflow, so I wanted to know if other people also think something like this is useful.</p>

      <div class="blog-content"><p>The official website of Laravel has already a <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/11.x">documentation</a> on howto install it on a Linux OS, but it requires to trust the installer script. This would have been run directly on the local machine without prior checking the contents and what is really done.
Of course I manually checked the install script and did not like what I found. The installed elements would not be tracked by the package manager, it would install another certificate authority list for the local installation. Things I consider non-maintainable or unsafe. So I wanted to go another (more clean?) way on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

      <div class="blog-content"><p>Whenever I log into a remote Linux based machine via SSH, I first start a GNU screen session. Any when I forget, I often regret it when I close the session window, as this also terminates the processes I usually want to continue in the background.</p>

      <div class="blog-content"><p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> is, in my opinion, a great tool for blocking ads, tracking and malware. But sometimes it seems to be blocking a bit too much.
One case I identified were sites that would come up as small ads in my Google searches. I still wanted those links to work.
My analysis showed that the needed target URL was nicely encoded in the advertisement URL. So I thought of <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> for a solution.</p>
