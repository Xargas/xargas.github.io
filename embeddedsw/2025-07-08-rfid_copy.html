  <p>Out of curiosity I wanted to know the contents of RFID cards. Sometimes I get such cards for access of certain places, sometimes they store health data for emergencies (e.g. blood type). But what happens if one breaks?
A replacement often costs more than just a new token with the necessary data saved on it. So I wanted a tool to be able to make backups.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>I wanted to be able to create backups of any kind of RFID card out there. While I did some research, I found that there are different types of cards and there is a chip that can read all common RFID cards: MFRC522.
So, my basic hardware setup was decided to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino Nano 3.3 BLE (nordicnrf52)</li>
  <li>RFID-RC522 board</li>
</ul>

<p>I used an Arduino with BLE because I had one by hand. An Arduino Nano without BLE will also do.</p>

<p>The wiring is straight forward using dupont wires. Just connect the SPI interface between the boards and supply the MFRC522 via the Arduino Nano.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I used the <a href="https://platform.io/">platform.io</a> environment in Visual Studio Code to create the necessary software for the embedded device. With this I was able to create and handle all functions by command line. 
The interface to the board was using UART over USB as it is easily available on Arduino boards. I created the UART interface to be interactive so I could use it via command line without looking up the commands. You can find the corresponding code on <a href="https://github.com/Xargas/rfid_copy">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>A while later I created a GUI app using C# with WPF in Visual Studio. It should only fully read or write a card. This made the project more accessible on PCs without UART terminal tool.</p>

<h2 id="final-device">Final device</h2>

<p>To actually have a usable device, I additionally designed a simple case to be 3D printed where the boards and the wiring fit in. I glued the lid and so I had a simple device for easy use. If you want to use the model you can find it on <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/1349708-rfid-read-write-and-copy-case">printables</a>.</p>
